================================================
ABElectronics ADC Differential Pi 8-Channel ADC read Resistance thermometer 
using a Wheatstone bridge.
This demo uses a Semitec NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) Thermistors
10kohm 1%, Manufacturer Part No: 103AT-11

Purchased from Mouser Electronics, Part No: 954-103AT-11

The circuit is connected to the + and - inputs on channel 7 on the 
ADC Differential Pi. This can also be used on the Delta Sigma Pi

The Wheatstone bridge is comprised of three 10K resistors and the 
Resistance thermometer

Version 1.0 Created 30/10/2015

Requires python3 smbus to be installed
run with: python3 demo-resistance-thermometer.py
================================================


    
Initialise the ADC device using the default addresses and 18 bit sample rate, 
change this value if you have changed the address selection jumpers
Bit rate can be 12,14, 16 or 18
