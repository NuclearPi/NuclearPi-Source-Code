================================================
ABElectronics IO Pi 32-Channel Port Expander - Read Write Demo
Version 1.0 Created 29/02/2015

Requires python 3 smbus to be installed
run with: python3 demo-iopireadwrite.py
================================================

This example reads pin 1 of bus 1 on the IO Pi board and sets pin 1 of bus 2 to match.  
The internal pull-up resistors are enabled so the input pin will read as 1 unless
the pin is connected to ground. 

Initialise the IOPi device using the default addresses, you will need to
change the addresses if you have changed the jumpers on the IO Pi

# Each bus is divided up two 8 bit ports.  Port 0 controls pins 1 to 8, Port 1 controls pins 9 to 16.
