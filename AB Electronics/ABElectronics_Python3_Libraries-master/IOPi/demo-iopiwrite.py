================================================
ABElectronics IO Pi 32-Channel Port Expander - Output Write Demo
Version 1.0 Created 29/02/2015

Requires python 3 smbus to be installed
run with: python3 demo-iopiwrite.py
================================================

This example uses the write_pin and writeBank methods to switch the pins
on and off on the IO Pi.

Initialise the IOPi device using the default addresses, you will need to
change the addresses if you have changed the jumpers on the IO Pi
